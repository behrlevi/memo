### Threat Emulation vs Threat Simulation

1. Threat emulation (aka adversary emulation, attack simulation, purple teaming is an intelligence-driven impersonation of real-world attack scenarios and TTPs in a controlled environment to test, assess and improve an organisation's security defences and response capabilities. This means that you seek to behave as the adversary would. Threat emulation aims to identify and mitigate security gaps before attackers exploit them.
2. In contrast, threat simulation commonly represents adversary functions or behaviour through predefined and automated attack patterns that pretend to represent an adversary. This implies that the actions taken during the exercise will combine TTPs from one or more groups but not an exact imitation of a particular adversary.
