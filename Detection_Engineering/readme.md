### Detection Types:
  1. Environment-based - changes based on configurations and baseline activities
     
     Configuration detection - misalignments within the current infrastructure

     Modelling - asset or activity baseline profile
  3. Threat-based - adversaryâ€™s activity - tactics, tools, artefacts etc.

     Indicators - good (whitelist) / bad (blacklist)

     Threat Behaviour - TTPs regardless of any specific indicators, can be paired with established workflows and playbooks
