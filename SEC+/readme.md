### Difference between strategic and operational risk
If a risk threatens the
very existence of an organization or the ability of the organization to
execute its business plans, that is a strategic risk that seriously jeopardizes
the organization's ongoing viability. On the other hand, if the risk only
causes inefficiency and delay within the organization, it fits better into the
operational risk category.
